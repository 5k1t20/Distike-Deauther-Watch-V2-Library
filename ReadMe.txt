Hello and thank you for looking at my library. I have very little in this library right now but I will expand. Here I will keep my documentation for my library.
There is not much right now but here we go:

startUp()

Begins the Distike watch.

troubleShootScreen()

Prints simple text on screen to test if it is working.
